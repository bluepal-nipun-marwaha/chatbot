Context: 
# agent_supervisor.py

## Overview:
The `agent_supervisor.py` file is designed to create a multi-agent system that assists users with various tasks, including online research, local file management, time management, and email processing. The key components of this system are individual agents, each specialized in a specific domain, and a supervisor that manages these agents. The agents utilize various tools to perform their tasks, such as searching academic papers, saving text files, setting timers, and logging emails. The file also incorporates environment variable management for secure configuration.

## ClassDef MemorySaver

The `MemorySaver` class is responsible for maintaining the state of the agents within the system. It allows agents to remember previous interactions and maintain context across user requests, which is crucial for providing coherent and relevant responses.

### Method __init__ (method BELONGING to MemorySaver)
The constructor method initializes an instance of the `MemorySaver` class.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Note**: This class is essential for ensuring that agents can provide contextually relevant responses based on previous interactions.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
memory = MemorySaver()
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# No output, but an instance of MemorySaver is created.
```

## FunctionDef create_react_agent (functions that DOES NOT BELONG to a class but are still present in the file)

The `create_react_agent` function is used to create individual agents that can perform specific tasks. Each agent is configured with a model, tools, and a prompt that defines its behavior.

**Parameters**:
- `model`: A string representing the model to be used by the agent (e.g., 'openai:gpt-4o-mini').
- `tools`: A list of tools that the agent can utilize to perform its tasks.
- `prompt`: A string that provides context and instructions for the agent's behavior.
- `name`: A string that names the agent.

**Returns**: An instance of the agent configured with the specified model, tools, and prompt.

**Note**: Each agent is tailored for specific tasks, and the prompt is crucial for guiding the agent's responses.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
search_agent = create_react_agent(
    model='openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    tools=[arxiv_tool, wiki_tool, web_search_tool],
    prompt='You are a search assistant...',
    name='search_assistant'
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# An instance of the search agent is created, ready to assist with online research.
```

## FunctionDef create_supervisor (functions that DOES NOT BELONG to a class but are still present in the file)

The `create_supervisor` function creates a supervisor that manages multiple agents. It directs user requests to the appropriate agent based on the context and the capabilities of each agent.

**Parameters**:
- `agents`: A list of agents that the supervisor will manage.
- `model`: The model to be used by the supervisor.
- `prompt`: A string that provides context and instructions for the supervisor's behavior.

**Returns**: An instance of the supervisor configured with the specified agents, model, and prompt.

**Note**: The supervisor is crucial for orchestrating the interactions between agents, ensuring that user requests are handled efficiently and accurately.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
supervisor = create_supervisor(
    agents=[search_agent, local_agent, datetime_agent, timer_agent, email_search_agent, email_logging_agent],
    model=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o-mini'),
    prompt='You are a supervisor managing the following agents...'
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# An instance of the supervisor is created, ready to manage the specified agents.
```

## Called_functions:
- **`create_react_agent`**: This function is used to create individual agents that can perform specific tasks. Each agent is configured with a model, tools, and a prompt that defines its behavior. It is called multiple times to create different agents, such as `search_agent`, `local_agent`, `timer_agent`, etc.

- **`create_supervisor`**: This function creates a supervisor that manages multiple agents. It directs user requests to the appropriate agent based on the context and the capabilities of each agent. It is called once to create the `supervisor` instance.

- **`load_dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, allowing for secure management of sensitive information like API keys. This function is called at the beginning of the file to ensure that the environment is set up correctly.

- **`MemorySaver`**: This class is used to maintain the state of the agents, ensuring that they can remember previous interactions and maintain context across user requests. An instance of `MemorySaver` is created at the beginning of the file.

Overall, this code sets up a sophisticated system of agents that can assist users with various tasks, including searching for information, managing local files, handling time-related requests, and processing emails. The supervisor orchestrates the interactions between these agents, ensuring that user requests are handled efficiently and accurately. 

### Suggestions:
- Consider adding error handling for cases where an agent may not be able to fulfill a request.
- It may be beneficial to log interactions for debugging and improving agent responses over time.
Generated documentation
(-Documentation ends-)

Reviewer agent suggestions:
1. **Add Function Descriptions for Missing Functions**: The documentation currently lacks descriptions for any additional functions that may be present in the code but are not documented. Ensure that all functions, including utility functions or helper methods, have a clear description of their purpose, parameters, and return values.

2. **Expand Examples Section**: The examples provided for the `create_react_agent` and `create_supervisor` functions are helpful, but consider adding more diverse examples that showcase different configurations of agents and supervisors. For instance, include examples with varying numbers of tools or different types of prompts to illustrate the flexibility of the functions.

3. **Clarify the Purpose of the `MemorySaver` Class**: While the documentation mentions that the `MemorySaver` class is essential for maintaining context, it could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how it achieves this. Consider adding a brief description of the methods or attributes within the `MemorySaver` class that facilitate this functionality.

4. **Include Input/Output Examples for `MemorySaver`**: The `MemorySaver` class currently lacks examples in its documentation. Adding input and output examples would help users understand how to utilize this class effectively. For instance, demonstrate how to store and retrieve memory states.

5. **Enhance the Overview Section**: The overview provides a good high-level understanding of the system, but it could be improved by briefly mentioning the types of tasks each agent is responsible for. This would give readers a clearer picture of the system's capabilities at a glance.

6. **Add Error Handling Notes**: In the notes section for the `create_react_agent` and `create_supervisor` functions, consider including a note about potential error handling. For example, mention what might happen if an invalid model name is provided or if the tools list is empty.

7. **Document Environment Variable Management**: The documentation mentions environment variable management but does not explain how it is implemented. Consider adding a brief section that describes how to set up the `.env` file and what kind of variables should be included for the system to function correctly.

8. **Improve Clarity in the Called Functions Section**: The descriptions in the Called Functions section could be more concise. For instance, instead of repeating the purpose of `create_react_agent` and `create_supervisor`, summarize their roles in one sentence and focus on their specific interactions with the agents.

9. **Consider Adding a Troubleshooting Section**: Including a troubleshooting section could be beneficial for users who encounter issues while using the system. This section could address common problems and their solutions, enhancing the overall usability of the documentation.
