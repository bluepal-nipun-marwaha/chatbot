Context: 
# agent_supervisor.py

## Overview:
The `agent_supervisor.py` file is designed to create and manage a suite of intelligent agents that assist users with various tasks, including online research, local file management, time management, and email handling. The key components of this file include the creation of multiple agents using the `create_react_agent` function, which are tailored to specific tasks, and a supervisor that coordinates these agents to respond to user requests effectively. The agents leverage various tools for their operations, such as searching academic papers, saving text files, logging user status, setting timers, and managing emails. The use of environment variables through `load_dotenv()` ensures that sensitive configurations are handled securely.

## ClassDef MemorySaver

The `MemorySaver` class is responsible for maintaining the state of the agents, allowing them to remember previous interactions and manage their tasks effectively. This class is crucial for ensuring that the agents can provide context-aware responses based on the user's history and preferences.

### Method MemorySaver.__init__(self)

The constructor method initializes an instance of the `MemorySaver` class. It sets up any necessary attributes or data structures required for memory management.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Note**: Ensure that the memory management is efficient to avoid excessive resource usage.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
memory = MemorySaver()
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# No output, but an instance of MemorySaver is created.
```

## FunctionDef create_react_agent

The `create_react_agent` function is used to create individual agents that can perform specific tasks. Each agent is configured with a model, tools, and a prompt that defines its behavior.

**Parameters**:
- `model`: A string representing the model to be used by the agent (e.g., 'openai:gpt-4o-mini').
- `tools`: A list of tools that the agent can utilize for its tasks.
- `prompt`: A string that provides context and instructions for the agent's behavior.
- `name`: A string representing the name of the agent.

**Returns**: An instance of the agent configured with the specified model, tools, and prompt.

**Note**: Ensure that the tools provided are relevant to the tasks the agent is expected to perform.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
search_agent = create_react_agent(
    model='openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    tools=[arxiv_tool, wiki_tool, web_search_tool],
    prompt='You are a search assistant...',
    name='search_assistant'
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# An instance of the search agent is created.
```

## FunctionDef create_supervisor

The `create_supervisor` function creates a supervisor that manages multiple agents. It coordinates their actions based on user requests and ensures that the most appropriate agent is used for each task.

**Parameters**:
- `agents`: A list of agents that the supervisor will manage.
- `model`: An instance of a model (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`) that the supervisor will use for communication.
- `prompt`: A string that provides context and instructions for the supervisor's behavior.

**Returns**: An instance of the supervisor configured with the specified agents and model.

**Note**: The supervisor should be designed to efficiently route user requests to the appropriate agent based on the context.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
supervisor = create_supervisor(
    agents=[search_agent, local_agent, datetime_agent, timer_agent, email_search_agent, email_logging_agent],
    model=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o-mini'),
    prompt='You are a supervisor managing the following agents...'
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# An instance of the supervisor is created.
```

## Called_functions:
- **`create_react_agent`**: This function is used to create individual agents that can perform specific tasks. Each agent is configured with a model, tools, and a prompt that defines its behavior.

- **`create_supervisor`**: This function creates a supervisor that manages multiple agents. It coordinates their actions based on user requests and ensures that the most appropriate agent is used for each task.

- **`load_dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, which is essential for managing sensitive information like API keys or configuration settings.

- **`MemorySaver`**: This class is used to maintain the state of the agents, allowing them to remember previous interactions and manage their tasks effectively.

Overall, this code sets up a sophisticated system of agents that can assist users with various tasks, from searching for information online to managing emails and local device operations. The supervisor orchestrates the interactions between these agents, ensuring efficient and context-aware responses to user requests. 

### Suggestions:
- Consider adding error handling for cases where tools may fail or return unexpected results.
- It may be beneficial to implement logging for the agents' actions to facilitate debugging and improve user experience.
- Ensure that the prompts provided to the agents are clear and concise to avoid ambiguity in their responses.
