This is the generated documentation for the source code. Please check its quality and accuracy, and provide suggestions for improvement. Your Suggestions HAVE TO BE specific and clear, so that the revisor can EASILY understand and implement them WITHOUT the knowledge of codebase.
Note: 
1. DO NOT change the documentation, your task is to review and provide suggestions for it.
2. Your suggestions should not contain REMOVE/DELETE instructions.
3. Your suggestions may involve ADDING Function Description for missing functions, Input/Output examples for missing functions to the ##Examples section, or improving the clarity of the documentation.

Context: 
# agent_supervisor.py

## Overview:
The `agent_supervisor.py` file is designed to create a multi-agent system that assists users with various tasks, including online research, local file management, time management, and email processing. The key components of this system are individual agents, each specialized in a specific domain, and a supervisor that manages these agents. The agents utilize various tools to perform their tasks, such as searching academic papers, saving text files, setting timers, and logging emails. The file also incorporates environment variable management for secure configuration.

## ClassDef MemorySaver

The `MemorySaver` class is responsible for maintaining the state of the agents within the system. It allows agents to remember previous interactions and maintain context across user requests, which is crucial for providing coherent and relevant responses.

### Method __init__ (method BELONGING to MemorySaver)
The constructor method initializes an instance of the `MemorySaver` class.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Note**: This class is essential for ensuring that agents can provide contextually relevant responses based on previous interactions.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
memory = MemorySaver()
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# No output, but an instance of MemorySaver is created.
```

## FunctionDef create_react_agent (functions that DOES NOT BELONG to a class but are still present in the file)

The `create_react_agent` function is used to create individual agents that can perform specific tasks. Each agent is configured with a model, tools, and a prompt that defines its behavior.

**Parameters**:
- `model`: A string representing the model to be used by the agent (e.g., 'openai:gpt-4o-mini').
- `tools`: A list of tools that the agent can utilize to perform its tasks.
- `prompt`: A string that provides context and instructions for the agent's behavior.
- `name`: A string that names the agent.

**Returns**: An instance of the agent configured with the specified model, tools, and prompt.

**Note**: Each agent is tailored for specific tasks, and the prompt is crucial for guiding the agent's responses.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
search_agent = create_react_agent(
    model='openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    tools=[arxiv_tool, wiki_tool, web_search_tool],
    prompt='You are a search assistant...',
    name='search_assistant'
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# An instance of the search agent is created, ready to assist with online research.
```

## FunctionDef create_supervisor (functions that DOES NOT BELONG to a class but are still present in the file)

The `create_supervisor` function creates a supervisor that manages multiple agents. It directs user requests to the appropriate agent based on the context and the capabilities of each agent.

**Parameters**:
- `agents`: A list of agents that the supervisor will manage.
- `model`: The model to be used by the supervisor.
- `prompt`: A string that provides context and instructions for the supervisor's behavior.

**Returns**: An instance of the supervisor configured with the specified agents, model, and prompt.

**Note**: The supervisor is crucial for orchestrating the interactions between agents, ensuring that user requests are handled efficiently and accurately.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
supervisor = create_supervisor(
    agents=[search_agent, local_agent, datetime_agent, timer_agent, email_search_agent, email_logging_agent],
    model=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o-mini'),
    prompt='You are a supervisor managing the following agents...'
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# An instance of the supervisor is created, ready to manage the specified agents.
```

## Called_functions:
- **`create_react_agent`**: This function is used to create individual agents that can perform specific tasks. Each agent is configured with a model, tools, and a prompt that defines its behavior. It is called multiple times to create different agents, such as `search_agent`, `local_agent`, `timer_agent`, etc.

- **`create_supervisor`**: This function creates a supervisor that manages multiple agents. It directs user requests to the appropriate agent based on the context and the capabilities of each agent. It is called once to create the `supervisor` instance.

- **`load_dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, allowing for secure management of sensitive information like API keys. This function is called at the beginning of the file to ensure that the environment is set up correctly.

- **`MemorySaver`**: This class is used to maintain the state of the agents, ensuring that they can remember previous interactions and maintain context across user requests. An instance of `MemorySaver` is created at the beginning of the file.

Overall, this code sets up a sophisticated system of agents that can assist users with various tasks, including searching for information, managing local files, handling time-related requests, and processing emails. The supervisor orchestrates the interactions between these agents, ensuring that user requests are handled efficiently and accurately. 

### Suggestions:
- Consider adding error handling for cases where an agent may not be able to fulfill a request.
- It may be beneficial to log interactions for debugging and improving agent responses over time.
