# chat_bot.py

## Overview:
The `chat_bot.py` file implements a chatbot interface using the Streamlit library, allowing users to interact with an AI assistant. The primary purpose of this file is to create a user-friendly web application where users can send messages and receive responses from the assistant. Key components include user profile management, message handling, and integration with an AI supervisor agent that processes user inputs and generates appropriate responses. The file utilizes session state to maintain user data and conversation history, ensuring a seamless chat experience.

## ClassDef HumanMessage

The `HumanMessage` class is imported from the `langchain.schema` module and is used to structure messages sent by the user to the assistant. This class encapsulates the content of the user's message, allowing for a standardized format when interacting with the AI supervisor.

### Method __init__ (method BELONGING to HumanMessage)
The constructor method initializes a new instance of the `HumanMessage` class.

**Parameters**:
- `content` (str): The text content of the message being sent by the user.

**Returns**:
- None

**Note**: This class is essential for ensuring that user messages are formatted correctly when sent to the supervisor agent.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
user_message = HumanMessage(content="Hello, how are you?")
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# The output is an instance of HumanMessage containing the user's message.
```

## FunctionDef supervisor.invoke

The `invoke` function is a method of the `supervisor` object imported from the `agent_supervisor` module. It is responsible for processing user messages and generating responses from the AI assistant.

**Parameters**:
- `messages` (dict): A dictionary containing the user's message structured as a `HumanMessage`.
- `configurable` (dict): A dictionary containing configuration options, such as `thread_id`, which uniquely identifies the session.

**Returns**:
- A dictionary containing the assistant's response, structured similarly to the input.

**Note**: This function is critical for the chatbot's functionality, as it connects the user input to the AI's processing capabilities. Proper error handling is necessary to manage potential issues during invocation.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
response = supervisor.invoke(
    {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="Hello, how are you?")]},
    {'configurable': {'thread_id': 'unique_session_id'}}
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# The output is a dictionary containing the assistant's response.
# Example: {'messages': [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'I am doing well, thank you!'}]}
```

## Called_functions:
- **`st.set_page_config`**: Configures the Streamlit app's title and icon, enhancing the user interface and providing a better user experience.

- **`st.sidebar`**: Creates a sidebar for displaying user profile information, including the user's avatar and username, which improves the layout and accessibility of user settings.

- **`st.chat_message`**: Displays messages in the chat interface, allowing for a conversational format. This function is used to render both user and assistant messages with appropriate avatars.

- **`st.chat_input`**: Captures user input from the chat interface, enabling interaction with the chatbot. This function is essential for receiving messages from the user.

- **`supervisor.invoke`**: This function is crucial as it sends the user's message to the supervisor agent, which processes the input and generates a response. It uses the `HumanMessage` class to structure the input properly.

Overall, this code implements a chatbot interface using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with an AI assistant. The assistant's responses are managed by a supervisor agent, which coordinates the conversation and handles user queries effectively. 

### Suggestions:
- Consider adding more error handling around the `supervisor.invoke` function to provide more informative feedback to the user in case of failures.
- It may be beneficial to allow users to customize their avatars and usernames directly within the chat interface for a more personalized experience.
Generated documentation
(-Documentation ends-)

Reviewer agent suggestions:
1. **Add Function Description for Missing Functions**: The documentation currently lacks descriptions for several functions that are called within the code. For example, functions like `st.set_page_config`, `st.sidebar`, `st.chat_message`, and `st.chat_input` should have a brief description of their purpose and how they contribute to the chatbot's functionality. This will help users understand the role of these functions in the overall application.

2. **Expand Examples Section**: The examples provided for the `HumanMessage` and `supervisor.invoke` functions are helpful, but they could be enhanced by including more diverse scenarios. For instance, consider adding examples that demonstrate how to handle different types of user inputs, such as questions, commands, or greetings. This will provide users with a clearer understanding of how to interact with the chatbot.

3. **Clarify Input/Output Structure**: In the output examples for both `HumanMessage` and `supervisor.invoke`, it would be beneficial to explicitly describe the structure of the output. For example, instead of just stating that the output is a dictionary, specify the keys and their expected values. This will help users anticipate the format of the responses they will receive.

4. **Include Error Handling Examples**: Since error handling is mentioned as a necessary aspect of the `supervisor.invoke` function, consider adding examples that illustrate how to handle potential errors. This could include scenarios where the input is invalid or the AI supervisor fails to generate a response. Providing these examples will guide users in implementing robust error handling in their own applications.

5. **User Profile Management Details**: The overview mentions user profile management but does not elaborate on how this is implemented. Consider adding a section that describes how user profiles are created, stored, and managed within the application. This will give users a better understanding of the user experience and the importance of user profiles in the chatbot's functionality.

6. **Session State Explanation**: The documentation briefly mentions the use of session state to maintain user data and conversation history. It would be helpful to include a short explanation of what session state is and how it is utilized in the application. This will provide context for users who may not be familiar with Streamlit's session state management.

7. **Consider User Experience Enhancements**: The suggestions at the end of the documentation could be expanded to include more specific ideas for improving user experience. For example, you could suggest implementing features like message timestamps, typing indicators, or a history of previous interactions, which would enhance the overall usability of the chatbot interface.
