# 1_profile_page.py

## Overview:
The `1_profile_page.py` file is designed to create a user profile setup page using the Streamlit library. The primary purpose of this file is to allow users to select an avatar and enter a display name, which will be saved in the session state for future interactions within the application. The key components of this file include the configuration of the web page, the display of a title, the creation of a dropdown menu for avatar selection, a text input for the username, and a button to save the user's choices. The interactions between these components facilitate a smooth user experience, enabling personalization of the user profile.

## FunctionDef st.set_page_config

- `page_icon` (str): The icon that represents the page, displayed in the browser tab.

### Returns:

```
**Output Example**:
The web page will display "üë§ Set Up Your Profile" prominently at the top.

## FunctionDef st.selectbox

The `st.selectbox` function creates a dropdown menu that allows users to select one option from a list. In this case, it is used for avatar selection.

### Parameters:

If the user selects "üê± Cat", the variable `choice` will hold the value "üê± Cat".

## FunctionDef st.text_input

The `st.text_input` function allows users to input text, which is used here for entering the display name.

### Parameters:
- `label` (str): The label for the text input field.
- `value` (str, optional): The default value for the text input.

### Returns:
The input text (str).

**Note**: Providing a default value can enhance user experience by pre-filling the input field.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
username = st.text_input("Enter your display name", value=st.session_state.get("username", "User"))
```
**Output Example**:
If the user types "Alice", the variable `username` will hold the value "Alice".

## FunctionDef st.button

The `st.button` function creates a clickable button that can trigger an action when clicked. In this case, it is used to save the user's profile information.

### Parameters:
- `label` (str): The text displayed on the button.

### Returns:
A boolean indicating whether the button was clicked (True) or not (False).

**Note**: The button should have a clear label to indicate its purpose.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
if st.button("‚úÖ Save and Continue"):
```
**Output Example**:
If the user clicks the button, the code inside the `if` block will execute, saving the profile information.

## FunctionDef st.success

The `st.success` function displays a success message on the web page, providing feedback to the user.

### Parameters:
- `message` (str): The message to be displayed.

### Returns:
None

**Note**: Providing feedback is crucial for user satisfaction and understanding of actions taken.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python

## Called_functions:
- **`st.set_page_config`**: Configures the web page's title and icon, which is essential for user experience.
- **`st.title`**: Displays the main title of the page, guiding users on what to do.
- **`st.selectbox`**: Allows users to choose an avatar, which enhances personalization.
- **`st.text_input`**: Captures the user's display name, which is important for user identification in the application.
- **`st.button`**: Triggers the saving of user preferences to the session state, ensuring that the user's choices persist across interactions.
- **`st.success`**: Provides feedback to the user, confirming that their profile has been saved successfully.

Overall, the code creates a simple user profile setup page where users can select an avatar and enter their display name, with their choices being saved for future interactions. 

### Suggestions:
- The `Image` class from the `PIL` library is imported but not used in the code. If image manipulation or display is not needed, consider removing this import to clean up the code.
- Consider adding error handling for cases where the user does not select an avatar or enter a username before clicking the save button. This will improve the robustness of the application.
