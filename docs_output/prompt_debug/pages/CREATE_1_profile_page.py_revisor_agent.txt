Context: 
# 1_profile_page.py

## Overview:
The `1_profile_page.py` file is designed to create a user profile setup page using the Streamlit library. The primary purpose of this file is to allow users to select an avatar and enter a display name, which will be saved in the session state for future interactions within the application. The key components of this file include the configuration of the web page, the display of a title, the creation of a dropdown menu for avatar selection, a text input for the username, and a button to save the user's choices. The interactions between these components facilitate a smooth user experience, enabling personalization of the user profile.

## FunctionDef st.set_page_config

The `st.set_page_config` function is used to configure the title and icon of the Streamlit web page. This function is essential for setting the initial appearance of the application.

### Parameters:
- `page_title` (str): The title of the web page, which appears in the browser tab.
- `page_icon` (str): The icon that represents the page, displayed in the browser tab.

### Returns:
None

**Note**: Proper configuration of the page title and icon enhances user experience and provides context about the application.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
st.set_page_config(page_title="User Profile", page_icon="üë§")
```
**Output Example**:
The browser tab will display "User Profile" as the title, and the user icon will appear as the page icon.

## FunctionDef st.title

The `st.title` function displays a title on the web page, providing users with context about the page's purpose.

### Parameters:
- `label` (str): The text to be displayed as the title.

### Returns:
None

**Note**: The title should be descriptive to guide users effectively.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
st.title("üë§ Set Up Your Profile")
```
**Output Example**:
The web page will display "üë§ Set Up Your Profile" prominently at the top.

## FunctionDef st.selectbox

The `st.selectbox` function creates a dropdown menu that allows users to select one option from a list. In this case, it is used for avatar selection.

### Parameters:
- `label` (str): The label for the dropdown menu.
- `options` (list): A list of options to be displayed in the dropdown.

### Returns:
The selected option (str).

**Note**: The selected option can be used to customize the user experience, such as displaying an avatar.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
choice = st.selectbox("Choose your avatar", list(pfp_options.keys()))
```
**Output Example**:
If the user selects "üê± Cat", the variable `choice` will hold the value "üê± Cat".

## FunctionDef st.text_input

The `st.text_input` function allows users to input text, which is used here for entering the display name.

### Parameters:
- `label` (str): The label for the text input field.
- `value` (str, optional): The default value for the text input.

### Returns:
The input text (str).

**Note**: Providing a default value can enhance user experience by pre-filling the input field.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
username = st.text_input("Enter your display name", value=st.session_state.get("username", "User"))
```
**Output Example**:
If the user types "Alice", the variable `username` will hold the value "Alice".

## FunctionDef st.button

The `st.button` function creates a clickable button that can trigger an action when clicked. In this case, it is used to save the user's profile information.

### Parameters:
- `label` (str): The text displayed on the button.

### Returns:
A boolean indicating whether the button was clicked (True) or not (False).

**Note**: The button should have a clear label to indicate its purpose.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
if st.button("‚úÖ Save and Continue"):
```
**Output Example**:
If the user clicks the button, the code inside the `if` block will execute, saving the profile information.

## FunctionDef st.success

The `st.success` function displays a success message on the web page, providing feedback to the user.

### Parameters:
- `message` (str): The message to be displayed.

### Returns:
None

**Note**: Providing feedback is crucial for user satisfaction and understanding of actions taken.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
st.success("Profile saved! You can now go to the chat.")
```
**Output Example**:
The message "Profile saved! You can now go to the chat." will be displayed on the web page.

## Called_functions:
- **`st.set_page_config`**: Configures the web page's title and icon, which is essential for user experience.
- **`st.title`**: Displays the main title of the page, guiding users on what to do.
- **`st.selectbox`**: Allows users to choose an avatar, which enhances personalization.
- **`st.text_input`**: Captures the user's display name, which is important for user identification in the application.
- **`st.button`**: Triggers the saving of user preferences to the session state, ensuring that the user's choices persist across interactions.
- **`st.success`**: Provides feedback to the user, confirming that their profile has been saved successfully.

Overall, the code creates a simple user profile setup page where users can select an avatar and enter their display name, with their choices being saved for future interactions. 

### Suggestions:
- The `Image` class from the `PIL` library is imported but not used in the code. If image manipulation or display is not needed, consider removing this import to clean up the code.
- Consider adding error handling for cases where the user does not select an avatar or enter a username before clicking the save button. This will improve the robustness of the application.
`Generated documentation`
(-Documentation ends-)

Reviewer agent suggestions:
1. **Function Description for Missing Functions**: The documentation does not include a description for the `st.session_state` object, which is crucial for understanding how user data is stored and retrieved. Consider adding a section that explains its purpose and usage in the context of this application.

2. **Input/Output Examples for `st.session_state`**: Since `st.session_state` is used to store the username, it would be beneficial to provide examples of how to set and retrieve values from it. For instance:
   - **Input Example**: 
   ```python
   st.session_state["username"] = "Alice"
   ```
   - **Output Example**: 
   ```python
   username = st.session_state.get("username", "User")  # This will return "Alice"
   ```

3. **Clarification on `st.selectbox` Options**: In the `st.selectbox` section, it would be helpful to clarify what `pfp_options` is, as it is referenced but not defined in the documentation. Consider adding a brief explanation or example of what `pfp_options` contains.

4. **Error Handling Section**: It would enhance the documentation to include a section on error handling, particularly for the `st.button` function. This could explain how to handle cases where the user does not provide a display name or select an avatar before clicking the save button. For example:
   ```python
   if st.button("‚úÖ Save and Continue"):
       if not username or not choice:
           st.error("Please select an avatar and enter a display name.")
       else:
           # Save the profile information
   ```

5. **User Experience Notes**: In the notes section for each function, consider adding a brief statement about the importance of user experience in the context of the application. For example, you could mention how clear labels and feedback messages contribute to a more intuitive interface.

6. **Overall Structure**: The overall structure of the documentation is clear, but consider adding a summary section at the end that encapsulates the main functionalities of the file. This could help readers quickly grasp the purpose and flow of the application.

7. **Consistent Formatting**: Ensure that the formatting of the examples is consistent throughout the documentation. For instance, some examples use inline comments while others do not. Standardizing this will improve readability.

By implementing these suggestions, the documentation will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the code and enhance the user experience for developers interacting with the codebase.
