Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **Imports**: The code imports the `streamlit` library for creating web applications and the `Image` class from the `PIL` library, although `Image` is not used in the provided code.
  
- **Page Configuration**: The `st.set_page_config` function is called to set the title and icon of the web page.

- **Title**: The `st.title` function displays the title "Set Up Your Profile" on the web page.

- **Profile Picture Options**: A dictionary `pfp_options` is created to store different avatar options (cat, dog, robot, alien) along with their corresponding image paths.

- **Avatar Selection**: The `st.selectbox` function creates a dropdown menu for users to select their avatar from the keys of the `pfp_options` dictionary.

- **Username Input**: The `st.text_input` function allows users to input their display name. It retrieves the current username from the session state or defaults to "User".

- **Save Button**: The `st.button` function creates a button labeled "Save and Continue". When clicked, it saves the selected avatar and username to the session state and displays a success message.

Input/Output Examples:
1. **Avatar Selection**:
   - **Input**: User selects "üê± Cat" from the dropdown.
   - **Output**: The session state is updated with the path to the cat image.

2. **Username Input**:
   - **Input**: User types "Alice" in the text input field.
   - **Output**: The session state is updated with the username "Alice".

3. **Save Button**:
   - **Input**: User clicks the "Save and Continue" button.
   - **Output**: A success message "Profile saved! You can now go to the chat." is displayed.

Called functions information:
- **`st.set_page_config`**: Configures the web page's title and icon, which is essential for user experience.
- **`st.title`**: Displays the main title of the page, guiding users on what to do.
- **`st.selectbox`**: Allows users to choose an avatar, which enhances personalization.
- **`st.text_input`**: Captures the user's display name, which is important for user identification in the application.
- **`st.button`**: Triggers the saving of user preferences to the session state, ensuring that the user's choices persist across interactions.
- **`st.success`**: Provides feedback to the user, confirming that their profile has been saved successfully.

Overall, the code creates a simple user profile setup page where users can select an avatar and enter their display name, with their choices being saved for future interactions.
