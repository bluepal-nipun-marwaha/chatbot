# mail_reader.py

## Overview:
The `mail_reader.py` file is designed to read and parse email logs from a specified file, allowing users to query recent emails based on various criteria. The key components of this file include the `parse_mail_log` function, which extracts email details from a log file, and the `get_recent_emails` function, which processes user queries to filter and retrieve relevant email information. Additionally, the file defines a `Tool` instance that wraps the `get_recent_emails` function, enabling its integration into larger applications or frameworks. The code utilizes regular expressions for parsing queries and the `dateutil` library for handling date strings, ensuring robust functionality for email retrieval.

## FunctionDef parse_mail_log

The `parse_mail_log` function reads a mail log file and parses its contents into a structured format, returning a list of emails with their details.

### Method parse_mail_log
**Parameters**:
- `filepath` (str): The path to the mail log file (default is "logs/mail_logs.txt").
- `limit` (int, optional): The maximum number of email entries to return.

**Returns**:
- A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains details of an email (Subject, From, Date, Body).

**Note**: 
- If the `limit` parameter is specified, only the last `limit` emails will be returned. If no emails are found, an empty list will be returned.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
parse_mail_log("logs/mail_logs.txt", limit=5)
```
This input reads the email log from the specified file and limits the output to the last 5 emails.

**Output Example**:
```python
[
    {"Subject": "Meeting Reminder", "From": "john@example.com", "Date": "2023-10-01", "Body": "Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow."},
    ...
]
```
This output is a list of dictionaries representing the last 5 emails parsed from the log file.

## FunctionDef get_recent_emails

The `get_recent_emails` function processes a query to filter and retrieve recent emails based on user input, returning a formatted string with the requested information.

### Method get_recent_emails
**Parameters**:
- `query` (str): A string containing the user's request for email information.

**Returns**:
- A string containing details of the filtered emails or a count of matching emails.

**Note**: 
- The function supports various query formats, including requests for specific senders, counts of emails, and filtering by date. If no matching emails are found, an appropriate message will be returned.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
get_recent_emails("who sent the last email?")
```
This input queries for the details of the last email received.

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
Email 1:
Subject: Meeting Reminder
From: john@example.com
Date: 2023-10-01
Body:
Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow.
```
This output provides the details of the last email received.

## Called_functions:
- **`open()`**: This built-in function is used to open the mail log file for reading. It is essential for accessing the email data stored in the file.

- **`readlines()`**: This method reads all lines from the opened file, allowing the function to process each line individually and extract email details.

- **`re.search()`**: This function from the `re` module is utilized to extract specific information from the query, such as the sender's email address or the number of emails requested.

- **`dateparser.parse()`**: This function from the `dateutil` library converts date strings into `datetime` objects for easier comparison and filtering of emails based on their dates.

- **`Tool`**: The `Tool` class from `langchain_core.tools` is used to create a tool that can be integrated into a larger framework, allowing the `get_recent_emails` function to be called as part of a toolset.

Overall, this code provides functionality for reading and filtering email logs, allowing users to query recent emails based on various criteria. It effectively structures the email data for easy access and manipulation. 

### Suggestions:
- Consider adding error handling for file operations to manage cases where the log file may not exist or is unreadable.
- It may be beneficial to implement logging for better tracking of function calls and potential issues during execution.
- Adding unit tests for both functions would help ensure their reliability and correctness over time.
`Generated documentation`
(-Documentation ends-)

Reviewer agent suggestions:
1. **Function Description for `get_recent_emails`**: The description could be enhanced by specifying the types of queries that can be processed. For example, mention that it can handle queries for specific senders, date ranges, or counts of emails. This will provide users with a clearer understanding of the function's capabilities.

2. **Input/Output Examples for `get_recent_emails`**: 
   - Add more diverse input examples to illustrate the function's versatility. For instance:
     ```python
     get_recent_emails("how many emails did I receive from john@example.com?")
     ```
     This input queries for the count of emails from a specific sender.
   - Include an output example for this query:
     ```plaintext
     You have received 3 emails from john@example.com.
     ```

3. **Clarification in the `parse_mail_log` Return Section**: It would be helpful to clarify what the keys in the returned dictionaries represent. For instance, you could add a brief note stating that "Subject", "From", "Date", and "Body" are the keys used to represent the respective email details.

4. **Error Handling Note**: In the "Note" section of both functions, consider adding a brief mention that users should ensure the log file exists and is formatted correctly to avoid unexpected errors during parsing.

5. **Enhance the Overview Section**: The overview could benefit from a brief mention of the expected format of the email log file. This will help users understand how to prepare their log files for parsing.

6. **Add a Section for Dependencies**: It would be useful to include a section that lists the external libraries used (e.g., `dateutil`, `re`) and their purpose in the code. This will help users understand the requirements for running the code.

7. **Consider Adding a Summary of Usage**: A brief summary at the end of the documentation on how to use the functions together could provide a clearer picture of the workflow. For example, explain that users should first call `parse_mail_log` to retrieve email data before using `get_recent_emails` to query that data.

By implementing these suggestions, the documentation will become more comprehensive, user-friendly, and informative, enhancing the overall understanding of the code's functionality.
