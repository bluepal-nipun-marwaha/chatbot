Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **`print_repoagent_summary()`**: This function generates and prints a summary of the classes and key methods related to a `RepoAgent`. It organizes the information into a dictionary and iterates through it to display the details in a readable format.

  - **Classes**:
    - **`GitHubFile`**: Represents a file on GitHub, containing information such as its content, path, and URL.
    - **`RepositoryInfo`**: Holds information about a GitHub repository, including its name, URL, and contents.
    - **`RepoAgent`**: A specialized agent designed to interact with GitHub repositories. It supports different operational modes, specifically FULL_CONTEXT and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) modes.

  - **Key Methods**:
    - **`__init__`**: Initializes the `RepoAgent` with necessary components like retrievers, models, and repositories.
    - **`parse_url`**: Parses a GitHub URL to extract the owner and repository name.
    - **`load_repositories`**: Loads the contents of multiple repositories.
    - **`load_repository`**: Loads a single repository using a GitHub client.
    - **`count_tokens`**: Returns the number of tokens in a given context or input.
    - **`construct_full_text`**: Concatenates the contents of multiple repositories into a single text for context.
    - **`add_repositories`**: Adds new repositories to the agent's context.
    - **`check_switch_mode`**: Checks if there is a need to switch to RAG mode based on the current context or input.
    - **`step`**: Retrieves context and passes the input to the model for processing.
    - **`reset`**: Resets the state of the agent, clearing any stored context or data.
    - **`search_by_file_path`**: Searches for and reconstructs file contents based on a specified file path.

Input/Output Examples:
1. **Function Call**:
   - **Input**: When the script is executed, the `print_repoagent_summary()` function is called.
   - **Output**: The console displays a summary of the classes and methods, formatted as follows:
     ```
     === RepoAgent Summary ===

     Classes:
     - GitHubFile: Holds GitHub file information (content, path, URL).
     - RepositoryInfo: Holds repository info (name, URL, contents).
     - RepoAgent: Specialized agent for GitHub repos. Supports FULL_CONTEXT & RAG modes.

     Methods:
     - __init__(): Initialize RepoAgent with retriever, model, repos, etc.
     - parse_url(): Parse GitHub URL → (owner, repo_name).
     - load_repositories(): Load contents of multiple repos.
     - load_repository(): Load a single repo using GitHub client.
     - count_tokens(): Return number of tokens.
     - construct_full_text(): Concatenate repos into full context text.
     - add_repositories(): Add new repo(s) to context.
     - check_switch_mode(): Check if switching to RAG mode is needed.
     - step(): Retrieve context + pass input to model.
     - reset(): Reset agent state.
     - search_by_file_path(): Search and reconstruct file contents by path.
     ```

Called functions information:
- **`print()`**: This built-in function is used to output the summary information to the console. It formats the output for readability, making it easy for users to understand the structure and functionality of the `RepoAgent`.

Overall, this code provides a concise overview of the `RepoAgent` and its associated classes and methods, serving as documentation for developers or users who need to understand the capabilities of the agent in the context of interacting with GitHub repositories.
