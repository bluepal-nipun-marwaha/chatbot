The content of the file (source code) is as follows:
```python
from langchain_core.tools import Tool
from datetime import datetime

def save_to_txt(data: str, filename: str = 'logs\\\\saved_logs.txt'):
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%D %H:%M:%S')
    formatted_text = f"------Research Output-------\n{timestamp}\n\n{data}\n\n"

    with open(filename, "a", encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(formatted_text)
    
    return f'Data successfully saved to {filename}'

save_txt_tool = Tool(
    name='save_text_to_file',
    func=save_to_txt,
    description='saved structured data to a text file'
)
```

Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **Imports**: The code imports necessary modules:
  - `Tool` from `langchain_core.tools` to create a tool for saving text data.
  - `datetime` from the `datetime` module to handle date and time operations.

- **`save_to_txt(data: str, filename: str = 'logs\\\\saved_logs.txt')`**: This function saves structured data to a specified text file.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `data`: A string containing the data to be saved.
    - `filename`: The name of the file where the data will be saved (default is 'logs\\saved_logs.txt').
  - **Functionality**:
    - Generates a timestamp in the format 'MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS'.
    - Formats the text to include a header with the timestamp and the data.
    - Opens the specified file in append mode and writes the formatted text to it.
    - Returns a success message indicating that the data has been saved.

- **`save_txt_tool`**: An instance of the `Tool` class that wraps the `save_to_txt` function, allowing it to be used as a tool in a larger application.

Input/Output Examples:
1. **Saving Data**:
   - **Input**: `save_to_txt("This is a test message.")`
   - **Output**: Returns a message like "Data successfully saved to logs\\saved_logs.txt" and appends the following content to the file:
     ```
     ------Research Output-------
     10/01/23 12:00:00

     This is a test message.

     ```

2. **Using Default Filename**:
   - **Input**: `save_to_txt("Another test message.")`
   - **Output**: Similar to the previous example, it saves the message to the default file 'logs\\saved_logs.txt'.

3. **Custom Filename**:
   - **Input**: `save_to_txt("Custom message.", "custom_log.txt")`
   - **Output**: Returns "Data successfully saved to custom_log.txt" and saves the message to the specified file.

Called functions information:
- **`datetime.now()`**: This function is used to get the current date and time, which is essential for timestamping the log entries.

- **`open()`**: This built-in function is used to open the specified file in append mode. It allows the function to add new entries without overwriting existing ones.

- **`write()`**: This method is called on the file object to write the formatted text to the file.

- **`Tool`**: The `Tool` class is used to create a tool that can be integrated into a larger framework, allowing the `save_to_txt` function to be called as part of a toolset.

Overall, this code provides a simple and effective way to save structured data to a text file, ensuring that each entry is timestamped and formatted for clarity. It can be easily integrated into larger applications that require logging or saving of output data.
