# timer.py

## Overview:
The `timer.py` file provides a simple implementation of a timer tool that allows users to set timers with notifications. It utilizes threading to run the timer in the background, ensuring that the main application remains responsive. The key components of this file include the `set_timer` function, which processes user input to determine the timer duration, and the `timer_thread` function, which handles the countdown and sends notifications upon completion. The file also integrates with the `plyer` library to provide desktop notifications, enhancing user interaction. The `Tool` class from `langchain_core.tools` is used to wrap the timer functionality, making it accessible as a tool in larger applications.

## FunctionDef timer_thread

The `timer_thread` function is responsible for executing the countdown for the timer and sending a notification when the timer finishes.

### Method timer_thread

**Parameters**:
- `seconds` (int): The duration of the timer in seconds.
- `message` (str): The message to display when the timer finishes.

**Returns**: None

**Note**: This function runs in a separate thread, allowing the main program to continue executing while the timer counts down. It is important to ensure that the `plyer` library is properly installed and configured to send notifications.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
# This function is called internally and does not take direct user input.
# However, it can be invoked as follows:
timer_thread(300, "Timer is Up!")
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
# After 300 seconds, a notification will appear with the title "Timer Finished" and the message "Timer is Up!".
```

## FunctionDef set_timer

The `set_timer` function processes user input to set a timer based on the specified duration in minutes.

### Method set_timer

**Parameters**:
- `user_input` (str): A string that specifies the duration of the timer (e.g., "5 minutes").

**Returns**: 
- A string indicating the status of the timer setup, either confirming the timer duration or requesting valid input.

**Note**: The function uses regular expressions to extract numeric values from the user input. If the input does not contain a valid duration, it returns an error message. The timer duration must be specified in minutes, and the function currently does not handle invalid formats gracefully.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
set_timer("5 minutes")
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
"Timer is set up for 5.0 minute(s)."
```

**Input Examples**: 
```python
set_timer("set a timer")
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
"Please specify timer duration in minutes"
```

**Input Examples**: 
```python
set_timer("5.5 minutes")
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
"Timer is set up for 5.5 minute(s)."
```

## Called_functions:
- **`time.sleep(seconds)`**: This function pauses the execution of the thread for the specified number of seconds, effectively implementing the countdown for the timer.

- **`notification.notify(title, message, timeout)`**: This function sends a desktop notification when the timer finishes, providing feedback to the user. The `title` is set to "Timer Finished", and the `message` is customizable based on the input to the `timer_thread`.

- **`re.search(pattern, string)`**: This function is used to find the first occurrence of a numeric value in the user input string, allowing the `set_timer` function to extract the timer duration.

- **`Thread(target, args)`**: This class is used to create a new thread that runs the `timer_thread` function, allowing the timer to operate asynchronously without blocking the main program.

Overall, this code provides a straightforward and effective way to set timers with notifications, allowing users to specify durations in a user-friendly manner. It can be easily integrated into larger applications that require timing functionalities. 

### Suggestions:
- Consider adding error handling for invalid user inputs to improve user experience.
- It may be beneficial to allow users to specify durations in seconds or hours in addition to minutes for greater flexibility.
- Implementing a way to cancel or reset the timer could enhance the functionality of the tool.
