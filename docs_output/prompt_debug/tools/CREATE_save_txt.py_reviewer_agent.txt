# save_txt.py

## Overview:
The `save_txt.py` file is designed to provide functionality for saving structured text data to a specified text file. It utilizes the `Tool` class from the `langchain_core.tools` module to create a reusable tool for this purpose. The file includes a function that formats the data with a timestamp and appends it to a log file, ensuring that each entry is clearly marked with the time it was saved. This is particularly useful for applications that require logging of research outputs or any other structured data.

Key components of the file include:
- The `save_to_txt` function, which handles the logic for saving data to a file.
- The `save_txt_tool` instance of the `Tool` class, which wraps the `save_to_txt` function, making it accessible as a tool in a larger application.

## FunctionDef save_to_txt

The `save_to_txt` function is responsible for saving a given string of data to a specified text file. It formats the data with a timestamp to provide context for when the data was saved.

### Method save_to_txt
This function takes two parameters: `data`, which is the string to be saved, and `filename`, which specifies the file where the data will be saved. If no filename is provided, it defaults to 'logs\\saved_logs.txt'.

**Parameters**:
- `data` (str): The string containing the data to be saved.
- `filename` (str): The name of the file where the data will be saved (default is 'logs\\saved_logs.txt').

**Returns**:
- (str): A success message indicating that the data has been saved to the specified file.

**Note**: 
- The function opens the file in append mode, which means that new data will be added to the end of the file without overwriting existing content. 
- Ensure that the directory specified in the filename exists, as the function does not create directories.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 

```python
save_to_txt("This is a test message.")
```
This input will save the message "This is a test message." to the default log file.

**Output Example**:

```
Data successfully saved to logs\\saved_logs.txt
```
The content appended to the file will look like this:
```
------Research Output-------
10/01/23 12:00:00

This is a test message.

```

## Called_functions:
The `save_to_txt` function utilizes several built-in functions and classes:

- **`datetime.now()`**: This function retrieves the current date and time, which is formatted into a string to serve as a timestamp for the log entry. This is crucial for tracking when each piece of data was saved.

- **`open(filename, "a", encoding='utf-8')`**: This built-in function opens the specified file in append mode. The `encoding='utf-8'` parameter ensures that the file can handle a wide range of characters, making it suitable for various types of data.

- **`write(formatted_text)`**: This method is called on the file object to write the formatted text (which includes the timestamp and the data) to the file.

- **`Tool`**: The `Tool` class is instantiated to create `save_txt_tool`, which allows the `save_to_txt` function to be used as a tool in a larger framework. This integration facilitates the use of the function in applications that require modular and reusable components.

Overall, the `save_txt.py` file provides a straightforward and effective way to log data with timestamps, making it a valuable tool for developers and researchers alike.
