Generated documentation
(-Documentation ends-)

Reviewer agent suggestions:
1. **Add Function Descriptions**: The documentation lacks descriptions for the `DuckDuckGoSearchRun`, `WikipediaAPIWrapper`, and `ArxivAPIWrapper` classes. Adding a brief description for each class would enhance clarity. For example:
   - `DuckDuckGoSearchRun`: "This class handles search queries to the DuckDuckGo search engine and processes the results."
   - `WikipediaAPIWrapper`: "This class provides a wrapper around the Wikipedia API for retrieving information based on search queries."
   - `ArxivAPIWrapper`: "This class wraps the Arxiv API to facilitate the retrieval of academic papers based on search queries."

2. **Expand Examples Section**: The examples provided for the `run` methods in each class could be expanded to include more detailed output examples. For instance, instead of just stating that it returns a list of results, you could provide a mock output to illustrate what the user might expect:
   - For `DuckDuckGoSearchRun.run()`, you could add:
     ```python
     # Example output:
     [
         {"title": "Python Programming", "link": "https://example.com/python"},
         {"title": "Learn Python", "link": "https://example.com/learn-python"}
     ]
     ```
   - Similar mock outputs could be added for the Wikipedia and Arxiv methods.

3. **Clarify Return Types**: In the return sections of the methods, it would be helpful to specify the type of objects contained in the lists returned by the `run` methods. For example, for `DuckDuckGoSearchRun.run()`, you could specify that it returns a list of dictionaries, each containing a title and a link.

4. **Add Error Handling Notes**: While the suggestion at the end mentions error handling, it would be beneficial to include a note in the documentation for each `run` method indicating that users should implement their own error handling when calling these methods, especially since they rely on external APIs.

5. **Include Usage Context**: In the overview section, consider adding a brief note on potential use cases for this module. For example, mention that it can be used in applications requiring information retrieval, such as chatbots, research tools, or educational platforms.

6. **Standardize Terminology**: Ensure that the terminology used throughout the documentation is consistent. For example, if you refer to "search results" in one section, avoid using "output" in another section when referring to the same concept. Consistency will improve readability and comprehension.

7. **Add a Summary Section**: At the end of the documentation, consider adding a summary section that briefly recaps the main functionalities of the module and its components. This can help users quickly understand the purpose and capabilities of the code.
