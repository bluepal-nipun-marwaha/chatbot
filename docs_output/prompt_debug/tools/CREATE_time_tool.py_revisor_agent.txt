# time_tool.py

## Overview:
The `time_tool.py` file is designed to provide functionality for retrieving the current date and time, with support for various timezones. It leverages the `datetime` module for date and time operations, the `pytz` library for timezone handling, and the `tzlocal` library to determine the local timezone of the system. The primary component of this file is the `get_current_datetime` function, which can return the current time in a specified timezone or the local time if no timezone is specified. Additionally, the file defines a `Tool` instance that wraps this function, making it suitable for integration into larger applications or frameworks.

## FunctionDef get_current_datetime

The `get_current_datetime` function retrieves the current date and time based on the specified timezone or returns the local date and time if no timezone is specified. This function is essential for applications that require accurate time representation across different regions.

### Method get_current_datetime

**Parameters**:
- `query` (str): A string that may contain a timezone abbreviation (e.g., "PST", "IST"). This parameter is optional and defaults to an empty string.

**Returns**:
- (str): A formatted string representing the current date and time in the specified timezone or the local timezone if no valid timezone is provided.

**Note**: 
- The function recognizes specific timezone abbreviations defined in the `timezones` dictionary. If the query contains an unrecognized abbreviation, the function defaults to returning the local date and time.
- It is important to ensure that the input query is in lowercase to match the keys in the `timezones` dictionary.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 

```python
get_current_datetime()  # No timezone specified
```

**Output Example**:

```
Local Timezone: America/New_York
 Monday, 01 January 2023
 12:00:00 PM
```

**Input Examples**: 

```python
get_current_datetime("pst")  # Specifying Pacific Standard Time
```

**Output Example**:

```
Timezone: US/Pacific
 Monday, 01 January 2023
 09:00:00 AM
```

**Input Examples**: 

```python
get_current_datetime("xyz")  # Unrecognized timezone
```

**Output Example**:

```
Local Timezone: America/New_York
 Monday, 01 January 2023
 12:00:00 PM
```

## Called_functions:
- **`get_localzone()`**: This function retrieves the local timezone of the system, which is essential for providing accurate local time. It is called to determine the timezone in which the application is running.

- **`datetime.now()`**: This function is used to get the current date and time. It is called twice: once for the local time and once for the specified timezone if a valid abbreviation is found in the query.

- **`pytz.timezone()`**: This function creates a timezone object based on the provided timezone string. It is crucial for converting the current time to the specified timezone.

- **`Tool`**: The `Tool` class is instantiated to create a tool that can be integrated into a larger framework. This allows the `get_current_datetime` function to be called as part of a toolset, enhancing its usability in various applications.

Overall, this code provides a simple and effective way to retrieve the current date and time, accommodating various timezones. It can be easily integrated into larger applications that require time-related functionalities. 

### Suggestions:
- Consider adding error handling for invalid timezone inputs to provide more informative feedback to the user.
- It may be beneficial to extend the `timezones` dictionary to include more timezone abbreviations for broader usability.
- Adding unit tests for the `get_current_datetime` function could help ensure its reliability and correctness across different scenarios.
`Generated documentation`

Reviewer agent suggestions:
1. **Function Description for `get_localzone()`**: Add a brief description of what the `get_localzone()` function does, including its purpose and return value. This will help users understand its role in the context of the `get_current_datetime` function.

2. **Function Description for `datetime.now()`**: Include a description of the `datetime.now()` function, explaining that it retrieves the current local date and time. This will provide clarity on its usage within the `get_current_datetime` function.

3. **Function Description for `pytz.timezone()`**: Add a description for the `pytz.timezone()` function, detailing how it creates a timezone object from a string and its importance in converting the current time to the specified timezone.

4. **Input/Output Examples for `get_current_datetime`**: 
   - Add an example for when a valid timezone is specified in uppercase (e.g., "PST") to demonstrate case sensitivity.
   - Include an example for when the function is called with an empty string explicitly to show that it defaults to local time.

5. **Clarification on Timezone Abbreviations**: In the "Note" section, clarify that the function is case-sensitive regarding the timezone abbreviations and that users should refer to the `timezones` dictionary for valid keys.

6. **Error Handling Suggestion**: Expand on the suggestion to add error handling by specifying that the function could raise a `ValueError` or return a specific error message when an unrecognized timezone is provided, enhancing user experience.

7. **Unit Tests Suggestion**: Elaborate on the suggestion to add unit tests by specifying that tests should cover various scenarios, including valid timezones, invalid timezones, and edge cases like daylight saving time changes.

8. **Overall Structure**: Consider adding a "Usage" section before the "Examples" section to provide a brief overview of how to use the `get_current_datetime` function in practice, which can help users understand its application better.
