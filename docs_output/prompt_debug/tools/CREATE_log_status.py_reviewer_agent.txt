# log_status.py

## Overview:
The `log_status.py` file is designed to facilitate the logging of user work statuses into a text file. It provides a simple interface for users to update their status, ensuring that only predefined valid statuses are accepted. The key components of this file include the definition of allowed statuses, a function to handle the logging process, and the integration of this function into a tool that can be utilized within a larger application framework. The file leverages Python's built-in `datetime` module to timestamp each log entry, enhancing the utility of the logged information.

## FunctionDef update_txt_status

The `update_txt_status` function is the core functionality of this file, responsible for logging the user's work status based on the provided input. It validates the input against a predefined set of allowed statuses, generates a timestamp, and writes the log entry to a specified text file.

### Method update_txt_status

**Parameters**:
- `option` (str): A string representing the user's status. It should be one of the predefined valid statuses.

**Returns**:
- A string message indicating the success or failure of the logging operation. If the status is valid and logged successfully, it returns a success message. If the status is invalid, it returns an error message. If there is an issue with file writing, it returns an error message detailing the failure.

**Note**: 
- The function is case-insensitive and trims whitespace from the input. 
- It is crucial to ensure that the file path for `status_logs.txt` is correct and accessible to avoid file writing errors.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 

```python
update_txt_status("work from home")
```
This input represents a valid status option that the user wishes to log.

**Output Example**:

```
"âœ… Status 'Work From Home' logged at 12/31/23 01:23:45 PM."
```
This output indicates that the status was successfully logged, along with the timestamp of the logging action.

**Input Examples**: 

```python
update_txt_status("on vacation")
```
This input represents an invalid status option that is not included in the allowed statuses.

**Output Example**:

```
"Invalid status option. Please choose one of: came to office, work from home, leave, sick leave."
```
This output indicates that the provided status is not valid and lists the acceptable options.

**Input Examples**: 

```python
update_txt_status("came to office")
```
This input represents a valid status option.

**Output Example**:

```
"Failed to log status: [error message]"
```
This output indicates that there was an issue with logging the status, such as a file access error.

## Called_functions:
- **`datetime.now()`**: This function retrieves the current date and time, which is essential for creating a timestamp for each log entry. It ensures that the logged status is associated with the exact time it was recorded.

- **`open()`**: This built-in function is used to open the log file in append mode. It allows the function to add new entries to the existing log without overwriting previous entries, maintaining a complete history of logged statuses.

- **`write()`**: This method is called on the file object to write the log entry to the file. It is crucial for persisting the logged status information.

- **`Tool`**: The `Tool` class from `langchain_core.tools` is utilized to create a tool that wraps the `update_txt_status` function. This integration allows the function to be used as part of a larger application, providing a structured way to log user statuses.

Overall, this code provides a straightforward and effective mechanism for users to log their work statuses, ensuring that only valid inputs are accepted and providing clear feedback on the logging process.
