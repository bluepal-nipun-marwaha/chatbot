## Overview:
This file contains a function that generates and prints a summary of the classes and key methods related to a specialized agent for interacting with GitHub repositories, referred to as `RepoAgent`. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a clear and organized overview of the components that make up the `RepoAgent`, including its associated classes (`GitHubFile`, `RepositoryInfo`, and `RepoAgent`) and their respective methods. This summary is useful for developers and beginners to understand the functionality and structure of the code, as well as the interactions between different components.

## FunctionDef print_repoagent_summary

The `print_repoagent_summary` function is responsible for creating and displaying a summary of the classes and key methods associated with the `RepoAgent`. It organizes this information into a dictionary and iterates through it to print the details in a user-friendly format.

### Method Details

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Note**: This function is intended to be called when the script is executed directly. It does not take any input parameters and does not return any values. It simply prints the summary to the console.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 

```
No input is required as this function is called when the script is executed.
```

**Output Example**:

```

```

## Called_functions:
- **`print()`**: This built-in function is utilized to output the summary information to the console. It formats the output for readability, making it easy for users to understand the structure and functionality of the `RepoAgent`.

### Suggestions:
- Consider adding more detailed descriptions for each method in the summary, especially regarding their parameters and return values, to enhance understanding for developers who may use or modify this code in the future.
- It may be beneficial to include error handling or logging within the `print_repoagent_summary` function to manage any potential issues that arise during execution, especially if this function is expanded in the future.
