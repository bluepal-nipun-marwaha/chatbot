Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **Imports**: The code imports necessary modules:
  - `Tool` from `langchain_core.tools` to create a tool for setting timers.
  - `Thread` from `threading` to run the timer in a separate thread.
  - `notification` from `plyer` to send desktop notifications.
  - `time` for handling time-related functions.
  - `re` for regular expression operations.

- **`timer_thread(seconds, message)`**: This function runs in a separate thread and handles the countdown for the timer.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `seconds`: The duration of the timer in seconds.
    - `message`: The message to display when the timer finishes.
  - **Functionality**:
    - The function sleeps for the specified number of seconds and then sends a notification with the provided message.

- **`set_timer(user_input: str)`**: This function sets a timer based on user input.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `user_input`: A string that specifies the duration of the timer (e.g., "5 minutes").
  - **Functionality**:
    - Uses a regular expression to extract the numeric value from the user input.
    - If no valid duration is found, it returns an error message.
    - Converts the duration from minutes to seconds.
    - Starts a new thread that runs the `timer_thread` function with the calculated seconds and a default message.
    - Returns a confirmation message indicating that the timer has been set.

- **`timer_tool`**: An instance of the `Tool` class that wraps the `set_timer` function, allowing it to be used as a tool in a larger application.

Input/Output Examples:
1. **Setting a Timer**:
   - **Input**: `set_timer("5 minutes")`
   - **Output**: Returns "Timer is set up for 5.0 minute(s)." and starts a timer for 5 minutes.

2. **Invalid Input**:
   - **Input**: `set_timer("set a timer")`
   - **Output**: Returns "Please specify timer duration in minutes" since no valid duration is provided.

3. **Decimal Minutes**:
   - **Input**: `set_timer("5.5 minutes")`
   - **Output**: Returns "Timer is set up for 5.5 minute(s)." and starts a timer for 330 seconds (5.5 minutes).

Called functions information:
- **`time.sleep()`**: This function is used to pause the execution of the thread for the specified number of seconds, effectively implementing the countdown for the timer.

- **`notification.notify()`**: This function sends a desktop notification when the timer finishes, providing feedback to the user.

- **`re.search()`**: This function is used to find the first occurrence of a numeric value in the user input string, allowing the function to extract the timer duration.

- **`Thread()`**: This class is used to create a new thread that runs the `timer_thread` function, allowing the timer to operate asynchronously without blocking the main program.

Overall, this code provides a simple and effective way to set timers with notifications, allowing users to specify durations in a user-friendly manner. It can be easily integrated into larger applications that require timing functionalities.
