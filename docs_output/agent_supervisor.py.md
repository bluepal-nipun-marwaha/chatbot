# agent_supervisor.py

## Overview:
The `agent_supervisor.py` file is designed to create and manage a suite of intelligent agents that assist users with various tasks, including online research, local file management, time management, and email handling. The key components of this file include the creation of multiple agents using the `create_react_agent` function, which are tailored to specific tasks, and a supervisor that coordinates these agents to respond to user requests effectively. The agents leverage various tools for their operations, such as searching academic papers, saving text files, logging user status, setting timers, and managing emails. The use of environment variables through `load_dotenv()` ensures that sensitive configurations are handled securely.

## ClassDef MemorySaver

The `MemorySaver` class is responsible for maintaining the state of the agents, allowing them to remember previous interactions and manage their tasks effectively. This class is crucial for ensuring that the agents can provide context-aware responses based on the user's history and preferences. It initializes data structures to store interactions and manage memory efficiently.

### Method MemorySaver.__init__(self)

The constructor method initializes an instance of the `MemorySaver` class. It sets up necessary attributes or data structures required for memory management, such as a list to store previous interactions.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Note**: Ensure that the memory management is efficient to avoid excessive resource usage.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
memory = MemorySaver()
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# No output, but an instance of MemorySaver is created.
```

### Additional Methods (Hypothetical)
If there are methods for saving or retrieving memory, they should be documented here. For example:

#### Method MemorySaver.save_memory(self, interaction)

This method saves a user interaction to memory.

**Parameters**:
- `interaction`: A string representing the user interaction to be saved.

**Returns**: None

**Examples**:
```python
memory.save_memory("User searched for AI research papers.")
```

#### Method MemorySaver.get_memory(self)

This method retrieves the stored interactions from memory.

**Returns**: A list of stored interactions.

**Examples**:
```python
previous_interactions = memory.get_memory()
```

## FunctionDef create_react_agent

The `create_react_agent` function is used to create individual agents that can perform specific tasks, such as searching for information, managing files, or handling emails. Each agent is configured with a model, tools, and a prompt that defines its behavior.

**Parameters**:
- `model`: A string representing the model to be used by the agent (e.g., 'openai:gpt-4o-mini').
- `tools`: A list of tools that the agent can utilize for its tasks.
- `prompt`: A string that provides context and instructions for the agent's behavior.
- `name`: A string representing the name of the agent.

**Returns**: An instance of the agent configured with the specified model, tools, and prompt.

**Note**: Ensure that the tools provided are relevant to the tasks the agent is expected to perform.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
search_agent = create_react_agent(
    model='openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    tools=[arxiv_tool, wiki_tool, web_search_tool],
    prompt='You are a search assistant that helps users find information online.',
    name='search_assistant'
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# An instance of the search agent is created.
```

**Complex Example**:
```python
search_agent = create_react_agent(
    model='openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    tools=[arxiv_tool, wiki_tool, web_search_tool],
    prompt='You are a search assistant that helps users find academic papers and general information.',
    name='search_assistant'
)

# The agent can now perform a search using the tools provided.
response = search_agent.perform_task("Find recent papers on AI.")
```

## FunctionDef create_supervisor

The `create_supervisor` function creates a supervisor that manages multiple agents. It coordinates their actions based on user requests and ensures that the most appropriate agent is used for each task. The supervisor evaluates the context of user requests and delegates tasks to the relevant agents.

**Parameters**:
- `agents`: A list of agents that the supervisor will manage.
- `model`: An instance of a model (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`) that the supervisor will use for communication.
- `prompt`: A string that provides context and instructions for the supervisor's behavior.

**Returns**: An instance of the supervisor configured with the specified agents and model.

**Note**: The supervisor should be designed to efficiently route user requests to the appropriate agent based on the context.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
supervisor = create_supervisor(
    agents=[search_agent, local_agent, datetime_agent, timer_agent, email_search_agent, email_logging_agent],
    model=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o-mini'),
    prompt='You are a supervisor managing the following agents...'
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# An instance of the supervisor is created.
```

**Detailed Example**:
```python
user_request = "Log my emails from the last week."
response = supervisor.handle_request(user_request)

# The supervisor determines that the email_logging_agent is the appropriate agent to handle this request.
```

## Called_functions:
- **`create_react_agent`**: This function is used to create individual agents that can perform specific tasks. Each agent is configured with a model, tools, and a prompt that defines its behavior. It is essential for setting up the agents that will assist users.

- **`create_supervisor`**: This function creates a supervisor that manages multiple agents. It coordinates their actions based on user requests and ensures that the most appropriate agent is used for each task. It plays a critical role in the overall system's functionality.

- **`load_dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, which is essential for managing sensitive information like API keys or configuration settings. This function ensures that the application can operate securely.

- **`MemorySaver`**: This class is used to maintain the state of the agents, allowing them to remember previous interactions and manage their tasks effectively. It is vital for providing context-aware responses.

## Error Handling
Consider implementing error handling for cases where tools may fail or return unexpected results. For example, if an agent attempts to access a tool that is unavailable, it should gracefully handle the error and inform the user.

### Common Errors:
- **Tool Failure**: If a tool fails to execute, the agent should catch the exception and provide a fallback response.
- **Invalid User Input**: Agents should validate user input and handle cases where the input does not match expected formats.

## Summary of Agent Capabilities
The agents created by this system can assist users with a variety of tasks, including:
- **Online Research**: Using tools like Arxiv, Wikipedia, and web search to find information.
- **Local File Management**: Saving text files and logging user status.
- **Time Management**: Setting timers and reporting the current date and time.
- **Email Handling**: Reading email logs and saving recent emails to logs.

Overall, this code sets up a sophisticated system of agents that can assist users with various tasks, from searching for information online to managing emails and local device operations. The supervisor orchestrates the interactions between these agents, ensuring efficient and context-aware responses to user requests.
