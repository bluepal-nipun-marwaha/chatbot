# agent_supervisor.py

## Overview:
The `agent_supervisor.py` file is designed to create a multi-agent system that assists users with various tasks, including online research, local file management, time management, and email processing. The key components of this system are individual agents, each specialized in a specific domain, and a supervisor that manages these agents. The agents utilize various tools to perform their tasks, such as searching academic papers, saving text files, setting timers, and logging emails. The file also incorporates environment variable management for secure configuration. Each agent is responsible for specific tasks:
- **search_agent**: Conducts online research using tools like Arxiv, Wikipedia, and Web Search.
- **local_agent**: Manages local file operations and user status logging.
- **timer_agent**: Sets timers on the local device.
- **datetime_agent**: Provides the current date and time.
- **email_logging_agent**: Logs recent emails from the inbox.
- **email_search_agent**: Searches through email logs for user queries.

## ClassDef MemorySaver

The `MemorySaver` class is responsible for maintaining the state of the agents within the system. It allows agents to remember previous interactions and maintain context across user requests, which is crucial for providing coherent and relevant responses.

### Method __init__ (method BELONGING to MemorySaver)
The constructor method initializes an instance of the `MemorySaver` class.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Note**: This class is essential for ensuring that agents can provide contextually relevant responses based on previous interactions.

### Method store_memory
Stores a memory state for an agent.

**Parameters**:
- `agent_name`: A string representing the name of the agent.
- `memory_state`: A dictionary containing the state information to be stored.

**Returns**: None

### Method retrieve_memory
Retrieves the memory state for a specific agent.

**Parameters**:
- `agent_name`: A string representing the name of the agent.

**Returns**: A dictionary containing the stored memory state for the specified agent, or None if no memory exists.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
memory = MemorySaver()
memory.store_memory('search_assistant', {'last_query': 'quantum computing'})
retrieved_memory = memory.retrieve_memory('search_assistant')
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# No output for store_memory, but memory is stored.
# Output for retrieve_memory:
{'last_query': 'quantum computing'}
```

## FunctionDef create_react_agent (functions that DOES NOT BELONG to a class but are still present in the file)

The `create_react_agent` function is used to create individual agents that can perform specific tasks. Each agent is configured with a model, tools, and a prompt that defines its behavior.

**Parameters**:
- `model`: A string representing the model to be used by the agent (e.g., 'openai:gpt-4o-mini').
- `tools`: A list of tools that the agent can utilize to perform its tasks.
- `prompt`: A string that provides context and instructions for the agent's behavior.
- `name`: A string that names the agent.

**Returns**: An instance of the agent configured with the specified model, tools, and prompt.

**Note**: Each agent is tailored for specific tasks, and the prompt is crucial for guiding the agent's responses. Error handling should be considered for cases where an invalid model name is provided or if the tools list is empty.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
search_agent = create_react_agent(
    model='openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    tools=[arxiv_tool, wiki_tool, web_search_tool],
    prompt='You are a search assistant...',
    name='search_assistant'
)

local_agent = create_react_agent(
    model='openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    tools=[save_txt_tool, log_status_tool],
    prompt='You are a local assistant...',
    name='local_assistant'
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# An instance of the search agent is created, ready to assist with online research.
# An instance of the local agent is created, ready to manage local tasks.
```

## FunctionDef create_supervisor (functions that DOES NOT BELONG to a class but are still present in the file)

The `create_supervisor` function creates a supervisor that manages multiple agents. It directs user requests to the appropriate agent based on the context and the capabilities of each agent.

**Parameters**:
- `agents`: A list of agents that the supervisor will manage.
- `model`: The model to be used by the supervisor.
- `prompt`: A string that provides context and instructions for the supervisor's behavior.

**Returns**: An instance of the supervisor configured with the specified agents, model, and prompt.

**Note**: The supervisor is crucial for orchestrating the interactions between agents, ensuring that user requests are handled efficiently and accurately. Error handling should be considered for cases where the agents list is empty.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```python
supervisor = create_supervisor(
    agents=[search_agent, local_agent, datetime_agent, timer_agent, email_search_agent, email_logging_agent],
    model=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o-mini'),
    prompt='You are a supervisor managing the following agents...'
)
```

**Output Example**:
```python
# An instance of the supervisor is created, ready to manage the specified agents.
```

## Called_functions:
- **`create_react_agent`**: This function is used to create individual agents that can perform specific tasks. It is called multiple times to create different agents, such as `search_agent`, `local_agent`, `timer_agent`, etc.

- **`create_supervisor`**: This function creates a supervisor that manages multiple agents. It is called once to create the `supervisor` instance.

- **`load_dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, allowing for secure management of sensitive information like API keys. This function is called at the beginning of the file to ensure that the environment is set up correctly.

- **`MemorySaver`**: This class is used to maintain the state of the agents, ensuring that they can remember previous interactions and maintain context across user requests. An instance of `MemorySaver` is created at the beginning of the file.

Overall, this code sets up a sophisticated system of agents that can assist users with various tasks, including searching for information, managing local files, handling time-related requests, and processing emails. The supervisor orchestrates the interactions between these agents, ensuring that user requests are handled efficiently and accurately.

## Environment Variable Management
To set up the environment for this system, create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. This file should include any necessary environment variables, such as API keys or configuration settings required for the agents to function correctly. For example:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while using the system, consider the following common problems:
- **Invalid Model Name**: Ensure that the model name provided to the agents is correct and supported.
- **Empty Tools List**: Verify that the tools list for each agent is populated with valid tools.
- **Environment Variables**: Check that the `.env` file is correctly set up and that all required variables are defined.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively utilize the multi-agent system and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
