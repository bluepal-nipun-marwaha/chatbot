## Overview:
This file contains a function that generates and prints a summary of the classes and key methods related to a specialized agent for interacting with GitHub repositories, referred to as `RepoAgent`. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a clear and organized overview of the components that make up the `RepoAgent`, including its associated classes (`GitHubFile`, `RepositoryInfo`, and `RepoAgent`) and their respective methods. This summary is useful for developers and beginners to understand the functionality and structure of the code, as well as the interactions between different components.

## FunctionDef print_repoagent_summary

The `print_repoagent_summary` function is responsible for creating and displaying a summary of the classes and key methods associated with the `RepoAgent`. It organizes this information into a dictionary and iterates through it to print the details in a user-friendly format.

### Method Details

**Purpose**: This function provides a concise overview of the `RepoAgent` class and its components, making it easier for users to understand the available functionality.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: None

**Note**: This function is intended to be called when the script is executed directly. It does not take any input parameters and does not return any values. It simply prints the summary to the console. This function is typically called in a command-line interface environment where the script is run directly.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 

```
No input is required as this function is called when the script is executed.
```

**Output Example**:

```
=== RepoAgent Summary ===

Classes:
- GitHubFile: Holds GitHub file information (content, path, URL).
- RepositoryInfo: Holds repository info (name, URL, contents).
- RepoAgent: Specialized agent for GitHub repos. Supports FULL_CONTEXT & RAG modes.

Methods:
- __init__(): Initialize RepoAgent with retriever, model, repos, etc.
- parse_url(): Parse GitHub URL â†’ (owner, repo_name).
- load_repositories(): Load contents of multiple repos.
- load_repository(): Load a single repo using GitHub client.
- count_tokens(): Return number of tokens.
- construct_full_text(): Concatenate repos into full context text.
- add_repositories(): Add new repo(s) to context.
- check_switch_mode(): Check if switching to RAG mode is needed.
- step(): Retrieve context + pass input to model.
- reset(): Reset agent state.
- search_by_file_path(): Search and reconstruct file contents by path.
```

**Significance of Modes**: The `FULL_CONTEXT` mode allows the agent to utilize all available information from the repositories, while the `RAG` (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) mode focuses on retrieving specific information to enhance the model's responses.

## Called_functions:
- **`print()`**: This built-in function is utilized to output the summary information to the console. It formats the output for readability, making it easy for users to understand the structure and functionality of the `RepoAgent`. The use of `print()` is essential for displaying the summary in a clear and organized manner, allowing users to quickly grasp the available classes and methods.

### Potential Use Cases:
- Developers can call `print_repoagent_summary` to quickly familiarize themselves with the `RepoAgent` and its capabilities when starting a new project.
- This function can be used in documentation generation processes to provide an overview of the available classes and methods in a user-friendly format.
- It can serve as a reference for debugging or enhancing the `RepoAgent` by providing a clear summary of its components.
