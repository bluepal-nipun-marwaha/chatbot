# log_status.py

## Overview:
The `log_status.py` file is designed to facilitate the logging of user work statuses into a text file. It provides a simple interface for users to update their status, ensuring that only predefined valid statuses are accepted. The key components of this file include the definition of allowed statuses, a function to handle the logging process, and the integration of this function into a tool that can be utilized within a larger application framework. The file leverages Python's built-in `datetime` module to timestamp each log entry, enhancing the utility of the logged information. The `Tool` class integrates with the `update_txt_status` function, allowing it to be used seamlessly within a larger application.

## FunctionDef update_txt_status

The `update_txt_status` function is the core functionality of this file, responsible for logging the user's work status based on the provided input. It validates the input against a predefined set of allowed statuses, generates a timestamp, and writes the log entry to a specified text file.

### Method update_txt_status

**Description**: 
Logs the user's work status to a text file after validating the input against predefined statuses.

**Parameters**:
- `option` (str): A string representing the user's status. It should be one of the predefined valid statuses: 'came to office', 'work from home', 'leave', 'sick leave'.

**Returns**:
- A string message indicating the success or failure of the logging operation. If the status is valid and logged successfully, it returns a success message. If the status is invalid, it returns an error message. If there is an issue with file writing, it returns an error message detailing the failure. The timestamp format in the return message is 'MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS AM/PM'.

**Note**: 
- The function is case-insensitive and trims whitespace from the input. 
- It is crucial to ensure that the file path for `status_logs.txt` is correct and accessible to avoid file writing errors.

### Examples:
**Example Input**: 

```python
update_txt_status("work from home")
```
This input represents a valid status option that the user wishes to log.

**Example Output**:

```
"✅ Status 'Work From Home' logged at 12/31/23 01:23:45 PM."
```
This output indicates that the status was successfully logged, along with the timestamp of the logging action.

**Example Input**: 

```python
update_txt_status("on vacation")
```
This input represents an invalid status option that is not included in the allowed statuses.

**Example Output**:

```
"Invalid status option. Please choose one of: came to office, work from home, leave, sick leave."
```
This output indicates that the provided status is not valid and lists the acceptable options.

**Example Input**: 

```python
update_txt_status("came to office")
```
This input represents a valid status option.

**Example Output**:

```
"✅ Status 'Came To Office' logged at 12/31/23 01:23:45 PM."
```
This output indicates that the status was successfully logged, along with the timestamp of the logging action.

**Example Input**: 

```python
update_txt_status("  work from home  ")
```
This input demonstrates the case insensitivity and whitespace trimming feature.

**Example Output**:

```
"✅ Status 'Work From Home' logged at 12/31/23 01:23:45 PM."
```
This output indicates that the status was successfully logged, confirming the function's handling of leading/trailing spaces.

**Example Input**: 

```python
update_txt_status("came to office")
```
This input represents a valid status option.

**Example Output**:

```
"Failed to log status: File not found."
```
This output indicates that there was an issue with logging the status, such as a file access error.

## Called_functions:
- **`datetime.now()`**: This function retrieves the current date and time, which is essential for creating a timestamp for each log entry. It ensures that the logged status is associated with the exact time it was recorded.

- **`open()`**: This built-in function is used to open the log file in append mode. It allows the function to add new entries to the existing log without overwriting previous entries, maintaining a complete history of logged statuses.

- **`write()`**: This method is called on the file object to write the log entry to the file. It is crucial for persisting the logged status information.

- **`Tool`**: The `Tool` class from `langchain_core.tools` is utilized to create a tool that wraps the `update_txt_status` function. This integration allows the function to be used as part of a larger application, providing a structured way to log user statuses.

Overall, this code provides a straightforward and effective mechanism for users to log their work statuses, ensuring that only valid inputs are accepted and providing clear feedback on the logging process.
